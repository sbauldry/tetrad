# tetrad
This respository contains three Stata commands for conducting Confirmatory Tetrad Analysis (CTA). In addition, the repository is set up so that the commands can be installed within Stata. Simply type "net from https://github.com/sbauldry/tetrad" without the quotes in Stata's command window. Click the tetrad link in the results window and then click on the "click here to install" link in the window that pops up. These commands are currently in development.
